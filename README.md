# arduino_Musicplayer
contains files and arduino sketch for playing audio using arduino

.wav files configurations
bit resolution : 8 Bit
 *  sampling rate  : 32000 Hz
 *  audio channel  : stereo
 
 
 SimpleSDAudio library needed to upload sketch to arduino.
 .zip file library added
 
 add to Arduino IDE by using ------>include zip library 
 
An actuator(linear) has been implemented which will oscillate during music playing. The sensor initiates Music on dfplayer and play song. Using the feedback available in df player chip, Motor oscillation movement duration failitated.
